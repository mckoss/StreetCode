# Bugs

X Nulls being displayed in textarea and imageURL on new Client items.
- Sponsor form does not have name field first?
- Models.py - parsing date fails with text timestamp.
- Read-only fields should not be displayed in editable fields (e.g. created and modified).
- When trying to switch to Python27 - get PageHandler not callable error from deep in webapp2
  - We're not even USING webapp2 - why is it being called?


# Admin and Forms

# REST Data
